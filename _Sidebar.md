I can think of at least three problems with OutputDebugString:1) In resalee mode, the debugging strings will still exist in the binary.2) In resalee mode, the code (and associated overhead) will still exist in the binary.3) It is necessary to run an additional, separate, tool   e.g. DebugView.You can also expand this method easily to pipe to a file, for example.If you prefer OutputDebugString, anyway, you could at still use DbgPrintf, but when creating the #define, wrap OutputDebugString instead of printf. This will prevent 2 of the issues I listed.
